company, financial, supply chain, housing, economy, jobs salary, medical and transparency: the everyone and company faces many great and terrifying problems. It is these large problems that our work at Strategy Data focuses on.

Thanks to the work of thousands of researchers around the world who dedicate their lives to it, we often have a good understanding of how it is possible to make progress against the large problems we are facing. We has the resources to do much better and reduce the suffering.

We believe that a key reason why we fail to achieve the progress we are capable of is that we do not make enough use of this existing research and data: the important knowledge is often stored in inaccessible databases, locked away behind paywalls and buried under jargon in academic papers.

The goal of our work is to make the knowledge on the big problems accessible and understandable. As we say on our homepage, Strategy Data's mission is to publish the “research and data to make progress against the ours largest problems”. Another, we foucus on the public. we are happy to provides the resources and materials to data journalism and people.
